# building python wrappers for cti routines
===========================================

0. wrapper code is in ctimodule.cpp in this dir. There is a test strategy 
   being developed based on compiling initially with -DWITHOUT_PYTHON to 
   check the routines, and then, once everything is correct, folloing the
   next stesp to build and install

1. build the correct Makefile.in (local for now) to describe compiler
   and linker options. To get these:

       cd ctitest
       rm -fR build
       python3 setup.py build

   Then pull the relevant details from the output.

2. back in this directory, build the necessary objects from the cascade source and the wrapper 
   code in ctimodule.cpp

   	make clean
  	make

3. you can now test the module by cd'ing to the directory with the library file (*.so) and
   starting python and trying to import it and use it...

   	cd build/lib.$(ARCH)/
   	python3
  	>>> import cti
   	>>> cti.chemtable_load("chemtable-file")
   	>>> cti.chemtable_lookup("T",0,0,0)

4. back in this directory, use python to install...

   	python3 setup.py install
