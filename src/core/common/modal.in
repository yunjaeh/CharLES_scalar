# on the second pass, you can optionally specify a cached correlation matrix
# that was written out from the first iteration.  if you don't it will build 
# the data correlation matrix again (which may be costly).  you can then 
# specify write modes and it will dump the mode that's closest frequency to 
# what is specified
# you can specify multiple WRITE_DMD_MODE and you could have done it on the 
# first pass as well.. 

# needs to be specified on both iteration...
